HTTPRequestDemoV1: Client code example interacting with server. Uses Java/Processing3
visionAPI-copy: Process image at server level

Image is sent with base64 encoding from client to server.
However,it seems that encoding64 in java and decoding64 in python
are not compatible as I am getting a badimageerror in python code
